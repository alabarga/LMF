# LMF
Linked matrix factorization (LMF) code for the integration of multiple linked data matrices [1], written primarily by [Michael O'Connell](https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/michael-o-connell/).  

'lmf_perm' performs a joint and individual LMF decomposiion with ranks selected by perumtation testing.

'lmf.cv' performs a joint and individual LMF decomposition with ranks selected by cross-validation.

'lmf_impute' performs missing value imputation using joing LMF

'lmf_impute_ji' performs missing value imputation using a joint and invidual LMG (LMF-JIVE)
